This is mostly going to be notes for myself


Created the initial typewritter function for dialogue text - this took me longer than I'd like to admit (didn't realize I needed to use settimeout as it's own function, was an easy fix)

Todos: 
css this up- find some art to use as fill ins for the time being
    -I need backgrounds, characters main characters and maybe button art.
create dialogue 
create characters
create a clean system for dialogue - include possibility for dialogue forks and affinity checks
    -I have a few ideas for this, one could just be a branching tree of dialogues re-creating buttons and adding certain points to certain variables depending on dialogue choice- with if checks dependent on those variables for special dialogues or actions)

i'm really considering hand coding all dialogue through continued typwritter functions - I have automated making dialogue and buttons-but it actually becomes just as convuluted once affinity checks and branching dialogue ends up happening. When branching paths end up happening, it's basically going to have to be manually typed anyway. I know it looks goofy but it makes more sense for me to just hand write everything with a simple copy paste.
